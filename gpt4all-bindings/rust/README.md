# gpt4all Rust

These are rust bindings for gpt4all. The bindings are split into two crates:

- `gpt4all-sys` - the raw bindings to the C API
- `gpt4all` - the safe rust wrapper around the raw bindings

See their respective READMEs for more information.

## Notes:

I've only tested this on Linux (specifically Fedora 38),
